1 (Kozhevnikov). 
      Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCP): How to construct a proof
      system for SAT with verifier checking only a constant number of bits 
      of a proof. Applications of PCP (show that it is hard to approximate
      the maximum satisfiability problem).

2 (Mints, Smozhenkov). 
      Public key cryptography: one-way functions and trapdoor functions,
      RSA encoding algorithm, randomized cryptography.

3 (Evdokimov). 
      Digital signatures: Why the present RSA scheme is not good enough,
      how to construct a better one, prove that it is secure if RSA is secure, 
      present (any) probabilistic signature scheme.

4 (Alexandrov). 
      One-way functions exist if and only if P != UP (prove it).

5 (Petrova, Sokolov). 
      Hard-core predicates: Construct one using any strongly one-way 
      permutation.

6 (Kuryashkin). 
      Pseudorandom generators (PRG) #1: Construct a generator 
      {0,1}^k --> {0,1}^{k+1} using any strongly
      one-way permutation.
      
7 (Chunaeva). 
      Pseudorandom generators (PRG) #2: For any polynomial P, 
      construct a generator {0,1}^k --> {0,1}^{P(k)}
      using any strongly one-way permutation.
 
8 (Sidorovskaya, Borisova). 
      Quantum algorithms #1: Grover's algorithm for search problems.

9 (Ananievskiy). 
      Quantum algorithms #2: Shor's algorithm for factoring.
