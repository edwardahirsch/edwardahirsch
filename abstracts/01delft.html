<P><B>Abstract.</B>   
It is a known approach to translate 
propositional formulas into systems 
of polynomial inequalities and to 
consider proof systems for the latter ones. 
The well-studied proof systems of this kind are the
<i>Cutting Planes</i> proof system (CP) utilizing linear
inequalities and the <i>Lovász-Schrijver calculi</i> (LS)
utilizing quadratic inequalities.  We introduce generalizations
LS<sup>d</sup> 
of LS that operate with polynomial inequalities of degree at most d.

<P>
It turns out that the obtained proof systems are very strong.
We construct polynomial-size bounded degree LS<sup>d</sup> proofs
of the <i>clique-coloring tautologies</i> (which have no polynomial-size
CP proofs), the <i>symmetric knapsack problem</i> (which has no
bounded degree Positivstellensatz Calculus proofs), 
and <i>Tseitin's tautologies</i> (which are hard for many known
proof systems). Extending our systems with a division rule 
yields a polynomial simulation of 
<i>CP with polynomially bounded coefficients</i>,
while other extra rules further reduce 
the proof degrees for the aforementioned examples.

<P>
Finally, we prove lower bounds on Lovász-Schrijver ranks
and on the "Boolean degree" of Positivstellensatz Calculus refutations.
We use the latter bound to obtain an exponential lower bound
on the size of <i>static LS<sup>d</sup></i> 
and <i>tree-like LS<sup>d</sup></i> refutations.
