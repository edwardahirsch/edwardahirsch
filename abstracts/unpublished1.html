This paper introduces different types  of picture grammars (or array
grammars) and plane finite automata with controlled reading. The proof
of the equivalence between classes of plane finite automata
languages and some of classes  of picture languages is given.
This paper also contains some results about the complexity of the
membership problem in different classes  of picture languages.
Namely, classes with linear-time and cubic-time decidable 
membership problem are found as well as classes with NP-complete
membership problem.
