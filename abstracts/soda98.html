<P><B>Abstract.</B>   

In 1980 B. Monien and E. Speckenmeyer
proved that satisfiability of a propositional formula consisting
of K clauses can be checked in time of the order 2<SUP>K/3</SUP>.
Recently O. Kullmann and H. Luckhardt
proved the bound 2<SUP>L/9</SUP>,
where L is the length of the input formula.
The algorithms leading to these bounds
(like many other SAT algorithms) are based
on splitting, i.e. they reduce SAT for a formula F
to SAT for several simpler formulas 
F<SUB>1</SUB>, F<SUB>2</SUB>, ... , F<SUB>m</SUB>.
These algorithms simplify each of 
F<SUB>1</SUB>, F<SUB>2</SUB>, ... , F<SUB>m</SUB>.
according to
some transformation rules such as the elimination of pure literals,
the unit propagation rule etc.
In this paper we present a new transformation rule
and two algorithms using this rule.
These algorithms have the bounds
2<SUP>0.30897K</SUP> and 2<SUP>0.10537L</SUP> respectively.
