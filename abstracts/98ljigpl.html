 How can we find any satisfying assignment for a Boolean formula that has
 many satisfying assignments? There exists an obvious
 <I>randomized</I> algorithm for solving this problem: one can just
 pick an assignment at random and check the truth value
 of the formula for this assignment,
 this is iterated until a satisfying assignment occurs.
 Does there exist a polynomial-time <I>deterministic</I> algorithm
 that solves the same problem? This paper presents such an algorithm
 and shows that its worst-case running time is linear when input formulas
 are in k-CNF and a fraction of satisfying assignments
 (among all possible assignments) is greater
 than a constant. This algorithm is almost the same as the algorithm
 proposed by Monien and
 Speckenmeyer (and independently by Dantsin) in the early 1980s for
 less than 2<SUP>n</SUP> steps 3-SAT decision.

 Another result of this paper is that if a formula in k-CNF
 has many satisfying assignments, then there exists a <I>short</I>
 satisfying assignment, i.e. an assignment of truth values to
 a small number of variables.
 The proposed algorithm yields just such a short satisfying assignment.
 We also show that there exist formulas in general CNF having many
 satisfying assignments, that have no short satisfying assignments.
