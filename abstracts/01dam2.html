<P><B>Abstract.</B>   

During the past three years there was a considerable growth in the number of 
algorithms solving MAX-SAT and MAX-2-SAT in worst-case time of the order
c<SUP>K</SUP>, where c&lt;2 is a constant, and K is the <I>number of clauses</I>
of the input formula. However, similar bounds w.r.t. the <I>number of variables</I>
instead of the number of clauses are not known. 

<P>
Also, it was proved that approximate
solutions for these problems (even beyond inapproximability ratios)
can be obtained faster than exact solutions. However, 
the corresponding exponents still depended on the 
<I>number of clauses</I> of the input formula.
In this paper, we give a
randomized (1-\epsilon)-approximation algorithm
for MAX-k-SAT whose worst-case time bound depends
on the <I>number of variables</I>.

<P>
Our algorithm and its analysis are 
based on Sch&ouml;ning's proof of the best current
worst-case time bound for k-SAT [Sch99].
Similarly to Sch&ouml;ning's algorithm
(which is also very close to Papadimitriou's algorithm [Pap91]
and the experimentally successful WalkSAT family by Selman et al. 
[SKC94,MSK97],
our algorithm makes random walks of polynomial length.
We prove that the probability of error in each walk is at most
1-c<SUB>k,\epsilon</SUB><SUP>-N</SUP>,
where N is the number of variables,
and c<SUB>k,\epsilon</SUB>&lt;2 is a constant depending on k and \epsilon.
Therefore, making 
\lceil-ln\rho\rceil * c<SUB>k,\epsilon</SUB><SUP>N</SUP> such walks
gives the probability of error
bounded from above by any predefined constant \rho&gt;0.
