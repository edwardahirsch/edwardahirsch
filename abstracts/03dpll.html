<P>
DPLL (for Davis, Putnam, Logemann, and Loveland) algorithms form
the largest family of contemporary algorithms for SAT (the propositional
satisfiability problem) and are widely used in applications.
The recursion trees of DPLL algorithm executions on unsatisfiable
formulas are equivalent to tree-like resolution proofs. Therefore,
lower bounds for tree-like resolution (which are known since 1960s)
apply to them.
 
<P>
However, these lower bounds say nothing about the behavior of such
algorithms on satisfiable formulas. Proving exponential lower bounds for
them in the most general setting would be equivalent to proving 
P\neq NP. In this paper, we give exponential lower bounds for two
families of DPLL algorithms: generalized "myopic" algorithms (that read
upto n<SUP>1-\epsilon</SUP> of clauses at each step and see the remaining part
of the formula without negations) and "drunk" algorithms (that choose a
variable using any complicated rule and then pick its value at random).
