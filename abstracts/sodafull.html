<P><B>Abstract.</B>   
In 1980 Monien and Speckenmeyer
proved that satisfiability of a propositional formula consisting
of K clauses (of arbitrary length) can be checked in time of the order 2<SUP>K/3</SUP>. 
Recently Kullmann and Luckhardt
proved the worst-case upper bound 2<SUP>L/9</SUP>,
where L is the length of the input formula. 
The algorithms leading to these bounds are based
on the splitting method which goes back to the Davis-Putnam procedure.
Transformation rules (pure literal elimination, unit propagation etc.) 
constitute a substantial part of this method. 
In this paper we present a new transformation rule and two algorithms using this rule.
We prove that these algorithms have the worst-case upper bounds 
2<SUP>0.30897K</SUP> and 2<SUP>0.10299L</SUP> respectively.
