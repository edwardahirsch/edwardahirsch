<P><B>Abstract.</B>   

<P>In this paper we present a new randomized algorithm for SAT, i.e.,
the satisfiability problem
for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form. 
Despite its simplicity,
this algorithm performs well on many common benchmarks
ranging from graph coloring problems to microprocessor verification.
Our algorithm is inspired by two randomized algorithms having
the best current worst-case upper bounds 
([PPSZ98,PPZ97] and [Sch99,SSW01]). 
We combine the main ideas of these algorithms 
in one algorithm.
The two approaches we use are local search
(which is used in many SAT algorithms, e.g., in GSAT [SLM92] and 
WalkSAT [SKC94]) 
and unit clause elimination (which is rarely used
in local search algorithms).
In this paper we do not prove any theoretical bounds.
However, we present encouraging results of computational experiments
comparing several implementations of our algorithm
with other SAT solvers.
We also prove that our algorithm is probabilistically 
approximately complete (PAC).
