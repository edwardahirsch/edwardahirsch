<h3>ISCAS and RTL formats</h3>

<p>
These two formats allow to conveniently encode arithmetic circuits. 
The RTL format is designed as an extension of the ISCAS format. 
Its difference from the ISCAS format is in the possibility to work 
with multi-bit variables (thus, ISCAS format does not allow NUM, SUM, MULT gates)
and with CLAUSE gate. Below we provide the description of the RTL format. 

<p>
Accepted gates: INPUT, OUTPUT, BUFF, NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, 
		XNOR, CLAUSE, MULT, SUM, NUM.

<p>
MULT, SUM, and NUM gates accept multi-bit variables, while all other 
gates work with bit variables only. 
Restrictions on variable names are the following: variable name should 
not start with '_' or contain one of the characters ',', ')', '(', '='; 
gate name cannot be used as a variable name.
A multi-bit variable can appear in the right 
hand side of an equality iff it appears in the left hand side of some previous
equality (this condition is needed for calculating the number of bits in 
resulting multi-bit variable). The number of bits in the sum of two multi-bit 
variables is equal to the maximum number of bits in these variables plus 1, 
the number of bits in the product is just a sum of these numbers. A variable 
cannot appear in the left hand side of an equality more than once (the only
exception is an appearance in the left-hand side of the NUM bit). Empty lines
in an input file are not allowed. Comments start with '#' (comments can start
only at the beginning of a string).

<tr><td valign=top>x = BUFF(y)</td><td>x = y, where x and y are bits</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>x = NOT(y)</td><td>x = 1 - y, where x and y are bits</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>x = AND(y, z)</td><td>x = (y and z), where x, y, and z are bits</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>x = OR(y, z)</td><td>x = (y or z), where x, y, and z are bits</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>x = NUM(y1, ..., yk)</td><td>x is a k-bit variable consisting of bits y1, ..., yk, 
			where y1 is the parity bit</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>x = SUM(y, z)</td><td>x = y + z, where x, y, and z are multi-bit variables, 
			such that the number of bits in y and z are known (that is, 
			y and z have to appear in the left hand side of some previous 
			equality with gate SUM, MULT, or NUM)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>x = MULT(y, z)</td><td>x = yz, where x, y, and z are multi-bit variables, such that
